        <p>
            I never thought that I would find a way out
            <br>I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
            <br>I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
            <br>But goddamn, you got me in love again
            <br>I used to think that I was made out of stone
            <br>I used to spend so many nights on my own
            <br>I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
            <br>But goddamn, you got me in love again
        </p>
        <p>
            Show me that heaven's right here, baby
            <br>Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
            <br>Never have I ever met somebody like you
            <br>Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
            <br>But goddamn, you got me in love again
        </p>
        <p>
            You got me in love again
            <br>You got me in love again
            <br>You got me in love again
            <br>Again
        </p>
        <p>
            So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
            <br>Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
            <br>I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
            <br>But goddamn, you got me in love again
        </p>
        <p>
            Show me that heaven's right here, baby
            <br>Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
            <br>Never have I ever met somebody like you
            <br>Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
            <br>But goddamn, you got me in love again
        </p>
        <p>
            You got me in love again
            <br>You got me in love again
            <br>You got me in love again
            <br>Again
        </p>
        <p>
            I can't believe, I can't believe
            <br>I finally found someone
            <br>I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
            <br>'Cause you're the one that I want
            <br>I can't believe, I can't believe
            <br>I'm not afraid anymore
            <br>Goddamn, you got me in love again
        </p>
        <p>
            La-la-la, la-la-la
            <br>La-la-la, la-la-la
            <br>I never thought that I would find a way out
            <br>I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
            <br>I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
            <br>Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
            <br>(We're in love, we're in love)
            <br>(We're in love, we're in love, oh, oh)
        </p>
        <p>
            I can't believe, I can't believe
            <br>I finally found someone

            <br>'Cause you're the one that I want

            <br>But goddamn, you got me in love again
        </p>
        <p>
            You got me in love again
            <br>You got me in love again
            <br>You got me in love again (again and again)
            <br>Again (and again and again and again)
